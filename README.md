# Internship Progress – Week 3

## Revising Computer Vision & LangChain, and Exploring Segmentation Models

---

## Overview

In Week 3 of my internship, I focused on revising **computer vision fundamentals** and **LangChain concepts** before working on the project problem statement. As part of the task, I was asked to explore possible **segmentation models** and **embedding models** that could be used for solving the problem.

During this week, most of my effort went into understanding and experimenting with **segmentation models**, while getting an initial understanding of how embedding models fit into the overall approach.

## Tasks Assigned

- Revise core **computer vision concepts**
- Revise basic **LangChain concepts**
- Understand the problem statement and think through solution approaches
- Explore suitable **segmentation models**
- Get an overview of **embedding models**
- Document observations and learnings

## What I Worked On

### Computer Vision Revision  
I revisited important computer vision topics such as image processing, object detection, and instance segmentation. This helped me better understand how segmentation models work and how their outputs can be used in the project.

---

### LangChain Concepts Revision  
I revised the basics of **LangChain**, including how chains are structured and how embeddings and retrieval workflows are generally used. This helped me understand where LangChain fits into the overall system design.

### Segmentation Model Exploration

I explored different segmentation models to understand their behavior and practical usability.

#### **Mask R-CNN**
- Used for player segmentation
- Produced segmentation masks but was slow in execution
- Missed certain visual details in some cases
- Less suitable for the project needs

#### **YOLOv8-Seg**
- Explored as an alternative segmentation approach
- Faster compared to Mask R-CNN
- Preserved important visual features more consistently
- Appeared to be more practical for the project

Based on these observations, **YOLOv8-Seg** seemed more suitable for the problem requirements.

### 🔹 Embedding Models (Overview)
Along with segmentation, I also gained a basic understanding of **embedding models** and how they are generally used for feature representation and similarity-based tasks. This helped me see how segmentation and embeddings work together in the overall solution.

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- Strengthened understanding of **computer vision fundamentals**
- Gained practical insight into **segmentation models**
- Learned how to compare models based on speed and output quality
- Revised essential **LangChain concepts**
- Understood the role of embeddings in the project workflow

## 📖 Summary

Week 3 was focused on revising foundational concepts and exploring different model options for the project. By revisiting computer vision and LangChain concepts and experimenting with segmentation models, I gained clarity on how these components fit into the overall solution.
